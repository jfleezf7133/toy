1. Scaling

  Some applications may not print correctly if scaling is 
  specified. In this case, please set its scaling at 100%.
  If the application has its own scaling function, please set 
  scaling from the application.

================================================================

2. Page Layout

  Some applications provide a function to print multiple sets of
  copies. However, do not use the function when a setting other 
  than [1 on 1] is selected for [Page Layout] in the [Page 
  Setup] sheet.
  If the function is used in the application, the data may not 
  be laid out properly.

================================================================

3. Separator Page

  [Separator page] on Windows cannot be printed.

================================================================

4. User Permission on the Installation

  Log on as a user with administrator rights to install the 
  printer driver. The Full Control Permission is required for 
  the installation.

================================================================

5. Downloading and Installing a Network Printer 
   (Windows 2000/XP/Server 2003)

  When downloading and installing a network printer on Windows 
  2000/XP/Server 2003, you can install it as a user without 
  administrator rights.
  If the network printer is installed by a user without 
  administrator rights, however, some functions may be 
  unavailable due to the restriction of operating system 
  security.

  [Unavailable functions]
  - Uninstaller cannot be registered in [Add or Remove Programs]
    ([Add/Remove Programs] for Windows 2000).

================================================================

6. Installation in a Multi-user Environment 
   (Windows XP/Vista/7/Server 2008)

  When this printer is installed in Windows 
  XP/Vista/7/Server 2008, do not install it for a user switched 
  by the "Fast User Switching" function of Windows 
  XP/Vista/7/Server 2008.
  When using the "Fast User Switching" function, be sure to log 
  on again before the installation.

================================================================

7. Uninstalling the network printer which is connected to 
   another user

  Even if you execute Uninstaller, information about the network
  printer which is installed on another user's local computer 
  is not deleted but remains in its operating system as 
  particular information to the user.
  If another user has installed the printer on its local 
  computer via the network, make sure that the user deletes the 
  network printer icon from the printer folder before you 
  execute Uninstaller.

================================================================

8. Restriction on the Network Printer

  When a network printer is installed, even though you change 
  its connection destination to a local port, the printer cannot
  be used as a local printer.
  If you use the printer as a local printer, uninstall the 
  installed network printer, select a local port, and then 
  install the printer driver anew.

================================================================

9. Restarting Windows with a print job remaining

  If you need to restart Windows with a print job remaining, 
  pause the print job from the printer folder. Then restart 
  Windows.

================================================================

10. The Protected Mode of Internet Explorer 
    (Windows Vista/7/Server 2008)

  If you are using Windows Vista/7/Server 2008 and run Internet 
  Explorer by clicking the icon for [Display Manual] etc. in 
  CD-ROM Setup, [Protected Mode] is set to [Off] regardless of 
  the settings.
  If you want to set [Protected Mode] to [On], exit Internet 
  Explorer once, and then run it again manually.

================================================================

11. Characters for the Printer Name 
    (Windows Vista/7/Server 2008)

  When an "@" character is used in the name of the printer, the 
  printer will become unrecognizable by the operating system 
  because of an invalid printer name thus disabling printing, 
  operation and setup.

================================================================

12. Registering Custom Paper Sizes (Windows Vista/7/Server 2008)

  Be sure to log on as a user with administrator rights when 
  editing [Custom Paper Size] in the [Page Setup] sheet in the 
  printer driver.

================================================================

13. Access Permission to the Printer Properties 
    (Windows Vista/7/Server 2008)

  When you log on as a user with administrator rights who is 
  different from the one install the printer driver, you cannot 
  access the printer properties as a user with administrator 
  rights.
  To access the printer properties, perform either of the 
  following procedures.

  - Windows Vista and Server 2008
    Right-click the printer icon, and then select [Run as 
    administrator].

  - Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2
    Click [Change Properties] in the [General] sheet in the 
    printer properties.

================================================================

14. Printing Thin Lines (Windows Vista/7/Server 2008)

  In certain applications, thickness of a line can be set to a 
  value smaller than 1 pt but the actual thickness in the 
  printout may be equivalent to that of a 1 pt line.

================================================================

15. Cautions for When Using Microsoft Excel

  When printing Microsoft Excel data which includes combined 
  cells, characters in the data may not be printed.

  Because the above phenomenon occurs by changing the display 
  settings in the [Preferences (Users)] or [Preferences 
  (Administrators)] dialog box in the Printer Status Window as 
  follows, be careful when changing the settings.

  - Setting [Display Timing Settings] to [When Starting 
    Printing] (default: [When Errors Occur])
  - Setting [Maximize Window When Displayed Automatically] to On
    (default: On)

================================================================

16. Cautions for When Upgrading from Windows Vista to Windows 7

  When upgrading the operating system from Windows Vista to 
  Windows 7, uninstall the printer driver first, upgrade the 
  operating system, and then reinstall the printer driver after 
  the upgrade.
  If you upgrade the operating system without uninstalling the 
  printer driver, the printer driver may not operate properly.
  In this case, uninstall the printer driver once, and then 
  reinstall the printer driver.

================================================================

17. Canon Driver Configuration Tool

  This driver supports the Canon Driver Configuration Tool 
  version 2.00 or later.
  However, you cannot use the Canon Driver Configuration Tool on
  the Windows 8 (64-bit) or Windows Server 2012 computer.
  You can change the factory default settings of the printer 
  driver to create customized driver sets using the Canon Driver
  Configuration Tool.
  For detailed information about this utility, refer to the 
  Canon Driver Configuration Tool User's Guide.
